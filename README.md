ðŸ’¥Myntra Data Analysis using PythonðŸ’¥

â™¦Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing Myntra's dataset using Python to derive meaningful insights about customer behavior, product performance, and order trends. The analysis aims to provide data-driven recommendations for business decision-making.

Dataset Description
The dataset consists of an Excel file with three sheets:
1. **dim_products** - Contains information about products available on Myntra.
2. **dim_customers** - Includes details of customers who have placed orders.
3. **fact_orders** - Stores transactional data related to customer orders.

## Objectives
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand key trends.
- Analyze customer demographics and purchasing behavior.
- Examine product popularity and sales trends.
- Identify order patterns and revenue distribution.
- Visualize insights using data visualization libraries.

## Tools & Technologies Used
